If your wedding is more than two weeks away, I offer the &quot;perfect timing&quot; option. \\r\\n1) Purchase the decal now \\r\\n2) Your order is entered into the Stixdesign wedding calendar\\r\\n3) I will make and ship your decal two weeks before the wedding. However I will mail a smaller sample monogram and the instructions now, so that you can familiarize yourself with the application process.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SHIPPING]\\r\\nI ship within 3-5 working days of receiving payment to the address given in your ETSY receipt, as it is verified by you at the time of sale. PLEASE INSURE IT IS CORRECT. If you would like me to use different address please let me know\\r\\n\\r\\n[ABOUT MY DECALS]\\r\\nAll my decals are made to order from the highest quality vinyl. Although usually these decals aren&#39;t re-usable, they are easily REMOVABLE for up to 2 years. All vinyl lettering comes pre-spaced, so you only have to apply one piece, making application a breeze. Due to the vinyl\\u2019s MATTE FINISH, there is no glare or reflection, and it has the appearance of being painted on your wall. The decals can be applied to almost any clean, smooth or semi-smooth surface, such as drywall, plaster walls, glass, mirrors, plastic, wood etc. It is best to wait approx. 3-4 weeks if you have freshly painted walls. Store flat and PUT UP THE DECAL WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS OF RECEIVING IT SO THAT IT IS EASY TO APPLY. I DO NOT RECOMMEND WAITING FOR MORE THAN 2-3 WEEKS. \\r\\n\\r\\n[WHOLESALE]\\r\\nIf you are a wedding professional and would like to establish an ongoing relationship please contact me for wholesale rates.", "PriceUSD":"20.00", "catID":"13"},
